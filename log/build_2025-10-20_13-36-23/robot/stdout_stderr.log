CMake Error: The current CMakeCache.txt directory /Users/coleaskey/Artemis6/build/robot/CMakeCache.txt is different than the directory /Users/coleaskey/ros2_ws/build/robot where CMakeCache.txt was created. This may result in binaries being created in the wrong place. If you are not sure, reedit the CMakeCache.txt
CMake Error: The source "/Users/coleaskey/Artemis6/src/robot/CMakeLists.txt" does not match the source "/Users/coleaskey/ros2_ws/src/robot/CMakeLists.txt" used to generate cache.  Re-run cmake with a different source directory.
